### PROBLEM STATEMENT

Improper waste sorting is a persistent issue that affects recycling efficiency and environmental sustainability. Many people struggle to correctly dispose of their waste in the designated bins, leading to contamination of recyclable materials and an increase in landfill waste. Traditional recycling programs rely on users to manually sort their waste, which often results in mistakes, either due to confusion or lack of knowledge. This problem is especially evident in public spaces such as universities, where incorrect waste sorting compromises the effectiveness of recycling efforts. A more intuitive, automated system is needed to streamline this process, making it easier for users to dispose of waste correctly without requiring manual sorting.


### PROPOSED SOLUTION

Our solution is an AI-powered waste recognition and sorting system designed to be a standalone, user-friendly technology. Instead of requiring users to download an app, the system will be deployed at public recycling stations with an integrated scanning screen. Users can simply hold their waste in front of the screen, which will use image recognition to analyze the material and direct them to the appropriate bin for disposal. Additionally, the system can be extended to automatically sort waste without user inputâ€”users can drop their trash, and the system will sort it into the correct bin using AI.

The focus of the project will be on developing and training a robust machine learning model capable of accurately recognizing different types of waste materials. The model will be trained and tested using various datasets to ensure high accuracy. This technology has the potential to be integrated into public waste management systems or industrial settings, contributing to a more sustainable and efficient recycling process.
